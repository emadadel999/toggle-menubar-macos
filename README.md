> **Note** if you don't wanna use Alfred, you can use the native apple appliction:
> - extract `toggle-menu-bar.zip`.
> - you need to give it assistive access, so head to `System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility`.
> - add the extracted apple application.
> This will only toggle the state from `Never` to `In Full Screen Only`.
